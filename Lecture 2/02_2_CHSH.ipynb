    "In this tutorial, you will run an experiment on a quantum computer to demonstrate the violation of the CHSH inequality with the Estimator primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH inequality, named after the authors Clauser, Horne, Shimony, and Holt, is used to experimentally prove Bell's theorem (1969). This theorem asserts that local hidden variable theories cannot account for some consequences of entanglement in quantum mechanics. The violation of the CHSH inequality is used to show that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. This is an important experiment for understanding the foundation of quantum mechanics.\n",

The first qubit will be measured also in orthogonal bases, but with an angle with respect to the second qubit, which we are going to sweep between $0$ and $2\\pi$. As you will see, the Estimator primitive makes running parameterized circuits very easy. Rather than creating a series of CHSH circuits, you only need to create *one* CHSH circuit with a parameter specifying the measurement angle and a series of phase values for the parameter.\n",
