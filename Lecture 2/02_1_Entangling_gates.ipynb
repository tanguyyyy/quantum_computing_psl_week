    "This combined state cannot be written as two separate qubit states, which has interesting implications. Although our qubits are in superposition, measuring one will tell us the state of the other and collapse its superposition. For example, if we measured the top qubit and got the state $|1\\rangle$, the collective state of our qubits changes like so:\n",
